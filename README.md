# ScienceDbGui

This is a skeleton project to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the form of a Single Page Web Application (SP WebApp). The GUI is meant to provide default Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) use cases to a set of Data Models accessed through Web Services. The project follows the philosophy that code generation is the best way to enable quick and easy, but also flexible, extension and maintainability.
